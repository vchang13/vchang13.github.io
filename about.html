      Hey all! My name is Victoria Chang and I am a sophomore Computer Science student
       at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm originally from a small town near
       Houston so coming to a tech hub like Austin has been quite a culture shock.
       Ever since I started learning more about computer science through summer
       programs, I've been passionate about using it to improving lives. I don't
       know much yet but I'm always ready to learn and experience new challenges!
       Currently, my technological interests involve machine learning and web development.
       When I'm not studying or figuring out how to use Twitter, I like to sew,
       knit, practice photo editing, and do anything creative. I can't wait for
       y'all to get to know me!
