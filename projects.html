            <b>Glass Bottle</b>
            A project for Google's Computer Science Summer Institute inspired by
            our group's stories of stress and anxiety in high school. After sharing
            stories of sleepless nights, testing anxiety, and the competitive nature
            of school, we decided to create a tool that allows people to vent about
            their problems without feeling like they're bothering others. This simple
            web app allows for users to vent their feelings and then symbolically
            send them off. If users would like to share their thoughts, an anonymous
            posts page saves them for all to read. My contributions to this project
            involves creating the glass bottle, posting, and sharing features as
            well as collaborating with other group members to implement Google login
             capabilities and the design of the site.

            <b>DotBook Task Organizer</b>
            A project for Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion Program inspired
            by our group's collective need for organization and love for stickers.
            Taking inspiration from bullet journalling, we created this rudimentary
            web app that could organize tasks and notes in a clean and simple manner
            while also allowing for personalization and fun. My contributions to
            this project involves creating the task making and note creation features
            and collaborating with other group members in creating stickers and
            their functionality.

            <b>$aveur</b>
            Created in twelve hours for the University of Texas at Austin's
            Women in Computer Science Hackathon (WiCS Hacks). Inspired by our frustrations
            with budgeting and inputing transactions by hand, we wanted to create
            a tool that could track transactions automatically as well as keep users
            accountable for their purchases. Using Capital One's Nessie API and
            the Google Maps API, we created a web app that uses your location and
            transactions to track, record, and limit your spending. My contributions
            to this project involves implementing the Google Maps API.
